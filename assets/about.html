        What is GEM?
    </h3>
    <p>It is a specialized database for genome editing, which aims to collect the exhastive dataset of metadata related
        to genome editing.</p>
    <p>Currently, GEM consists primarily of a subset of genome editing-related metadata from PubMed articles. Metadata
        is extracted from research articles that have the contents with experiments using either of 7 types of genome
        editing tools: CRISPR-Cas9, TALEN, ZFN, CRISPR-Cas12, CRISPR-Cas3, Base editor, and Prime editor</p>
    <p>Please see details for xxxxx</p>

    <h3>
        How to use?
    </h3>
    <p>web UI provides statistics of the dataset in four contexts: publication years, species, NGS data availability,
        and each genome editing tool (CRISPR-Cas9, TALEN, ZFN, CRISPR-Cas12, CRISPR-Cas3, Base editor, Prime editor)</p>
    <p>Users are able to interactively check the statistics by selecting the area in the statistical
        histograms. If an user clicks the selected area, the table corresponds to the selected dataset appears under the
        histogram figures, which can be exported to the local computer as comma separated value (csv). </p>
    <p>The whole dataset
        is also shown as the pagination table on the buttom of the web UI. Each column of the table can be
        sorted or filtered and the filtered dataset can be exported as csv.</p>
